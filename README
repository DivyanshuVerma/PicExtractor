An application which downloads images from www.carwalls.com
When you start the program, it crawls the pages of the site,
and simultaneously, it downloads the images that are not on the computer.
Once you have crawled the whole website, then it downloads and crawls only those images and websites that are not downloaded.
This version is developed for downloading only car wallpapers. The subsequent sections for bikes will be added in later versions.
